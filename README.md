# My studies, documents and tools for Blue Team

![canvas](https://github.com/xssrae/Blue-Team-Notes/blob/main/IMAGES/canvas.png)

In this repository I have all my Obsidian notes of my studies in Blue Team. Some directories have notes that I haven't been ended for many reasons but should be cool to see updates to this repository.

Feel free to use and consult them if you want.
