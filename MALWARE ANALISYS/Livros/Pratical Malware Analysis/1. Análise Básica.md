**Host-based signatures**, or indicators, ==are used to detect malicious code on victim computers. These indicators often identify files created or modified by the malware or specific changes that it makes to the registry.== Unlike antivirus signatures, malware indicators focus on what the malware does to a system, not on the characteristics of the malware itself, which makes them more effective in detecting malware that changes form or that has been deleted from the hard disk. 

**Network signatures** are ==used to detect malicious code by monitoring net-
work traffic. Network signatures can be created without malware analysis, but signatures created with the help of malware analysis are usually far more
effective==, offering a higher detection rate and fewer false positives.

# Malware Analysis Techniques
## **Basic Static Analysis**
Basic static analysis consists of ==examining the executable file without viewing the actual instructions. Basic static analysis can confirm whether a file is malicious, provide information about its functionality, and sometimes provide information that will allow you to produce simple network signatures==. Basic static analysis is straightforward and can be quick, but it’s largely ineffective against sophisticated malware, and it can miss important behaviors.

## **Basic Dynamic Analysis** 
Basic dynamic analysis techniques involve ==running the malware and observ-
ing its behavior on the system in order to remove the infection, produce
effective signatures, or both==. 

## **Advanced Static Analysis**
Advanced static analysis consists of ==reverse-engineering the malware’s internals by loading the executable into a disassembler and looking at the program instructions in order to discover what the program does==. The instructions are executed by the CPU, so advanced static analysis tells you exactly what the program does. However, advanced static analysis has a steeper learning curve than basic static analysis and requires specialized knowledge of disassembly, code constructs, and Windows operating system concepts, all of which you’ll learn in this book.
## **Advanced Dynamic Analysis** 
Advanced dynamic analysis uses a debugger to examine the internal state of a
running malicious executable. Advanced dynamic analysis techniques provide another way to extract detailed information from an executable. These techniques are most useful when you’re trying to obtain information that is
difficult to gather with the other techniques.
